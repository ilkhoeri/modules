$:description
useDocumentTitle helps you dynamically redefine the document title displayed in the browser title bar or on a page tab.

The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

$:explanation
_Note:_ useDocumentTitle runs on the client side so the title you set will be applied when the page is mounted. So, you can create a more accurate initial title for the SEO of your web application, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!

$:notes
Here are some tips for creating a good title:

- Go for a longer, descriptive title (avoid one- or two-word titles).
- Search engines will display about 50-60 characters of the title, so try not to have titles longer than that.
- Do not use just a list of words as the title (this may reduce the page's position in search results).
