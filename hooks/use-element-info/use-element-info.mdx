$:explanation

windowSize returns the interior width and height of the window in pixels (that is, the width and height of the window's [layout viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Layout_viewport)).
The read-only [innerWidth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerWidth) and [innerHeight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerHeight) property of the [Window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) interface returns the interior height of the window in pixels, that includes the width of the vertical scroll bar, if one is present and the height of the horizontal scroll bar, if present.
